Ionic Course

Ionic is a complete open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development, built on top of AngularJS and Apache Cordova. To assist other people learning this technology and improve myself by adding new tools to my toolbox, I created this course.

This repository stores and shares the slides and samples for my ionic course.

Ionic2Course.pdf: the slides of the Ionic 2 course lecture.

AdvancedUI: demonstrating some advanced UI topics, such as list, slider, custom pipe, custom directive, navigation between pages.

HttpService: demonstrating how to request http server to retrieve JSON data.

MyFirstApp: demonstrating how to create an ionic app, run an ioinic app on brower, emulator, and real device.

SaveData: demonstrating how to store data in local storage and SQLite database.

SimpleUI: demonstrating some basic UI topics, such as binding, calling functions from view, show alert or popups, etc.

You are welcome to download these samples and slides to learn Ionic development and give me some constructive feedback. 

Thansk for reading this far, happy coding!
